=== Configure the search results. 
To configure the search results, the following action must be taken. 

* The <FeatureName>SearchResult data structure in the BFF yaml must be adapted. 

** All the data that should be displayed in the results must be in that data structure either on top-level or in sub data structures. 

** The data should be as minimal as possible to not create to much load to the backend and DB. 

* The enums must be mapped to translation keys. 

** TODO 

* The column mappings must be defined. 

** TODO: Takeover from Annikas draft
