By default, a diagram is created which counts the different values in a column and shows the results. To use this diagram, the column which should be displayed needs to be selected first. The member 'columnId' holds the column id of the column to display.

[#action-9]
=== ACTION S9: Select the column to be displayed

The `+columnId+` is the key of the column to use for the result diagram. You can select any column you defined in the search results.

_Adapt in File:_ `+<feature>-search.component.ts+`
